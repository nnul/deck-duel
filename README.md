# Deck Duel (v0.2.7)

Deck Duel is a two player card game played with a single deck of cards and a set of dice or counters. It could be considered an extension of the card game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29). Each player flips over the top card of their deck and the high card wins. Ties are resolved during the next round.

However, unlike War, each player maintains a health counter and points for performing actions. The deck consists of only a single card suit and face cards have special abilities when played.

## Requirements

- A standard 52-card deck of playing cards
- 2 - 12-sided dice (or another method of tracking health)
- 2 - 4-sided dice (or 6 *will* counters)
- 4 - 6-sided dice
- 1 - penny for tracking initiative (or any small object)

## Object

The object of the game is to be the last player standing at the end of the duel.

## Setup

Each player starts with 13 cards and a set of dice.

### Cards

Divide a standard 52-card deck of playing cards into four groups by suit. Each player chooses a single suit of cards as their playing deck. Shuffle your cards and place them face down in front of you.

### Dice

Each player will need a 12-sided die (health tracker), a 4-sided die (or three *will* counters), and two 6-sided dice for managing *aggression* and *guard* points. When using a die for tracking, set the current point value face up on the die.

### Counters

A counter can be any small object used for number tracking. Counters can be used in-place of a die for all health and point tracking if it is more convenient.

A single, shared counter or token is required to keep track of which player currently has initiative. A penny is suggested.

## Playing

### Start

Each player rolls a 6-sided die to determine who has initiative. Initiative indicates which player will go first when spending *will* in the Prep Phase. At the end of each turn initiative passes to the player who won the combat phase.

Shuffle your cards and place them face down in front of you. Your opponent is given the option to cut your deck after every reshuffle. Players start with 10 health and 3 *will*.

### Phases

There are two phases during each round of the duel. The Prep Phase and the Combat Phase.

#### Prep Phase

Before combat, each player can concentrate their *will* into one of two areas: *aggression* or *guard*. *Aggression* increases the damage dealt on a win in combat and *guard* is used to evade incoming damage during a loss in combat. Only a single *will* can be spent per turn in this manner. The maximum total per area can never exceed +3. See the section on **concentration** for more details.

The player with initiative spends their *will* first or can choose to not spend any. The other player can then spend their will in response.

#### Combat Phase

Each player flips over the top card of their deck and places it face up in play. The highest card wins this turn of combat. The available outcomes from a win are dependent on the winning card. All cards give the winning player the option to deal +1 damage to their opponent or increase their *will* by one. In addition the Ace and all face cards have additional behaviors. In the case of a tie both players increase their concentration in *aggression* by +1 and the combat phase is resolved.

##### Win

The winner of combat chooses one of the following actions to perform:

1. Deal card damage (+1 or +2 for **A\***) plus any bonus damage from *aggression*.
2. Gain +1 *will*. This can only be used if *will* is currently below 3.
3. Use a face card ability. See **face cards** for more details.

##### Loss

The loser of combat can respond by using *guard* points to evade incoming damage. Any damage not evaded in this way is removed from that players health. If a player takes damage while they have *aggression* points, those points are lost and must be removed from play.

#### Face Cards

Face cards give you additional options in combat. However, these options are only available when a combat phase is won. If a player loses combat with a face card it provides not advantage. This is also true in the case of a tie, where both players will not be afforded these abilities.

##### King (**K**)

The **K** allows you to gain *focus*. This gives special meaning to the Ace by turning it from the worst card in the deck (**A**) into the best card in the deck (**A\***). To gain *focus* you take the **K** and place it sideways next to your discrd pile. This is the only action you take this turn if choosen.

##### Queen (**Q**)

The **Q** grants you health. You can choose to gain +1 health this turn. Additionally, a single *will* point can be spent to gain another +1, resulting in +2 health this turn. Only 1 *will* can be spent in this manner. This can be done for a maximum total health of 12. No further health can be gained beyond 12.

##### Jack (**J**)

The **J** grants you foresight. You can choose to peak at the top card of your deck, with the option to immediately discard it. Additionaly, a single *will* point can be spent to peak at another card. Only 1 *will* can be spent in this manner. Both cards can be viewed, but the order cannot be changed and only the top card can be discarded.

##### Ace (**A**)

The **A** is the worst card in the deck. It results in a complete loss of *concentration* and the players deck being reshuffled. See **reshuffling** and **concentration** for more details.

##### Ace with focus (**A\***)

The **A\*** is the best card in the deck. When the **K** is used to gain *focus* it causes the **A** to become the **A\***. It deals +2 damage this turn instead of +1 and the players deck is reshuffled. The deck is always reshuffled on any Ace, but on an **A\*** there is no loss in concentration. See **concentration** for more details on this step.

### Concentration

*Will* points are spent in the prep phase to gain concentration in two areas: *aggression* and *guard*. No more than +3 can ever be gained in a single area. When gaining concentration place a die face up with the current value on the concentration section for that area.

Concentration points are used during the combat phase to impact the outcome. Each *aggression* point spent during a successful combat grants +1 damage this turn, for a maximum of +3 damage. Each *guard* point spent during a loss in combat reduces damage by -1 this turn, for a maximum of -3.

Aggression is maintained as long as a player takes no damage. If a player takes damage then all accumulated *aggression* points are lost. Aggression is not lost if all incoming damage is evaded by using *guard* points.

All concentration is lost when an unfocused **A** is played. This is immediate and occurs **before** damage is dealt in the combat phase, allowing the winning player to inflict all damage reguardless of how much guard existed before combat started.

### Reshuffling

When an Ace is played that player will end their turn by reshuffling their deck and starting a new round. At the beginning of every round that players *will* points are reset to 3. If an unfocused **A** was played all concentraion points are removed. If an **A\*** was played any existing concentration is carried into the next round.

### Winning

To win, be the first player to reduce their opponents health below 1.
